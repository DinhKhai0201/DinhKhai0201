## 1. Talk about myself
My name is Khai, and I am a Software Engineer with over 4 years of experience working with JavaScript, TypeScript, and popular frameworks like React.js and Next.js.

In my previous role as a Full-Stack Developer at Luxtech Company, I worked on important projects such as Music Beat Trading and an NFT marketplace, across different industries like business, music, booking, and blockchain. My contributions were recognized for helping the company achieve its goals through a positive attitude and a strong work ethic.

For the past two years, I have also led my team in building high-quality products with clean and maintainable code, always delivering on time. I enjoy working in fast-paced environments where technologies change quickly, and I consistently find creative ways to solve problems and deliver effective solutions

I have strong expertise in front-end and full-stack development, focusing on React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and JavaScript (ES6+). I’m also skilled in Node.js, RESTful APIs, GraphQL, and familiar with Redux and Git. My coding approach prioritizes clean, scalable code, and I use Jest and Cypress for testing to ensure quality. I also have solid experience in Agile development and working with CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment.
I’m familiar with working in collaborative environments and have worked with cross-functional teams, from product managers to designers, to create user-focused products. I’ve also mentored junior developers and emphasize clear communication and teamwork.

I’m excited to apply because of your company’s innovative projects and strong engineering culture. This role offers the chance to grow my skills and contribute to impactful projects while working alongside a team that values continuous learning and creative problem-solving.
