To the HR Team:

My name is Khai, and I am an experienced Software Engineer with over 4 years of expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, and frameworks such as React.js and Next.js. I am excited to apply for the Frontend Developer (React.js) position at TOPPA SOLUTIONS. I believe my skills, qualities, and values align well with the needs of your growing team.

Work History
In my previous role as a Full-Stack Developer at Luxtech Company, I participated in major projects like Music Beat Trading and an NFT marketplace, across diverse industries including business, music, booking, and blockchain. My contributions were recognized for supporting the company's overall objectives with a positive attitude and strong work ethic.

Additionally, over the past two years, I have led my team in creating high-quality products with clean, maintainable code, always delivered on time. In a fast-paced environment with constantly evolving frameworks and technologies, I consistently found creative ways to develop and implement compelling, effective solutions.

I would love the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to connect further.
